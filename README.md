# IUrixl
Hello, my nickname is IUrixl, but you can call me Uriel (since it's my real name lol).
I'm a 16 years old guy who loves programming and everything related to it.
I started with this love with the computers thing since i was 8 years old.
My native language is spanish, so if you notice that my english is not that good now you know why.\

My favourite languages are Lua ( As you could have noticed ) and Rust!
