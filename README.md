# IUrixl
Hello, my nickname is IUrixl, but you can call me Uriel (since it's my real name lol).
I'm a 15 years old guy who loves programming and everything related to it. 
I started with this love with the computers thing since i was 9 years old.
My native language is spanish, so if you notice that my english is not that good now you know why.

## Worked on
I published here my [XySeries](https://github.com/IUrixl/XyMeshTool), a devtool for Love2d programmers. It's pretty interesting and it may be helpfull to you. \
I coded and made [Rise a Beluga](https://www.roblox.com/games/9610831222/Small-Update-Raise-a-Beluga) a roblox game heavily inspired by [Rise a Floppa](https://www.roblox.com/games/9772878203/raise-a-floppa-2-4x-Cash)\
I made [VasaltScript](https://github.com/IUrixl/VasaltScript)
